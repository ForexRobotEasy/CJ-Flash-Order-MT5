## Description

The CJ Flash Order MT5 EA is designed to simplify forex trading by allowing users to place trades based on their risk amount and stop loss. The EA includes a user interface with a button for manually opening trades and a drag and drop feature for quick trade execution.

The EA calculates the lot size based on the user-defined risk amount and stop loss. The risk amount can be specified either in percentage of the account balance or in USD. The lot size is calculated using the formula: lotSize = riskAmount / (stopLoss * tickSize), where tickSize is the minimum price change for the symbol being traded.

The EA supports both buy and sell orders. For buy orders, the take profit level is set above the current price by the stop loss amount. For sell orders, the take profit level is set below the current price by the stop loss amount.

The EA includes error handling for common trade execution errors, such as trade rejection, invalid volume, and connection issues. It also provides callbacks for trade execution and error scenarios.
